            <h1>Device Not Powering On?</h1>
            <p>If your device is not turning on, please try the following troubleshooting steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Charge the Device:</strong> Ensure your device is connected to a working power outlet and charger for at least 30 minutes. A completely drained battery might take some time to show signs of life.</li>
                <li><strong>Forced Restart:</strong> Press and hold the power button for 10-15 seconds. This can resolve minor software glitches. Refer to your device manual for specific forced restart combinations if this doesn't work.</li>
                <li><strong>Check Charger and Cable:</strong> Try using a different charger and USB cable to rule out a faulty accessory.</li>
                <li><strong>Inspect for Damage:</strong> Look for any visible physical damage to the device or charging port.</li>
            </ol>
